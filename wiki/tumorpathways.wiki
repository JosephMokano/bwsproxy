= Tumor types and Pathways  =

Combining many sources of information, we were able to create a dataset containing more than 5,000 genes mutated in cancers. A fisher's test has been applied to identify pathways (Kegg, Biocarta and Reactome), processes (Gene Ontology Biological Process) and protein domains (Interpro) that contain more mutated genes than expected by chance.

This web-service provides the resulting associations between the tumour types and cellular processes, pathways, and protein domains containing a significant number of mutated genes. Three threshold values (0.1, 0.01, 0.001) can be used to filter the fisher's test results. 

The information is provided in graphml format. Fore each tumour type the list of mutated gene is also provided. 

The raw data is also available to download in tab separate format:
